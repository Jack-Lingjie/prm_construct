我有一个result.jsonl文件, 其中每一个qid有很多条，这里我选取了qid70和71的两条数据，帮我统计每一个qid的gt_answer和pred的众数是否相等，总数是指每个qid的pred answer中出现最大的选项，例如qid70中有10个c,两个a,则众数是c，可以统计每个category的总数，和gt_answer和pred的众数相等的数量，得到每个category的正确率，并计算出总的正确率，给出处理的python代码

This implies that advertisements should avoid promoting behaviors or emotions that could harm people.\nStep 3: Review the options to identify the one that best matches typical advertising regulatory bodies' suggestions.\nStep 4: Options A, C, and G suggest promoting safe practices, which is more about what advertisements should encourage rather than avoid. Options B, E, H, and I suggest promoting or causing \"unsafe practices,\" \"wants,\" \"jealousy,\" or \"fear,\" which could be detrimental to consumers. Option F mentions promoting \"safe practices,\" \"distress,\" \"jealousy,\" and \"serious\" offence, which also seems counterintuitive to typical regulatory goals.\nStep 5: Option D, which suggests that advertisements must not encourage \"unsafe practices,\" cause \"distress,\" or \"fear,\" and must not cause \"trivial\" offence, seems the most aligned with typical advertising regulatory bodies' suggestions. It aligns with the goal of protecting consumers and maintaining a healthy social environment.\nThe answer is: D", "hard_estimation": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], "soft_estimation": [0.47058823529411764, 0.23809523809523808, 0.18181818181818182, 0.2, 0], "gt_answer": "I", "pred": "D"}
