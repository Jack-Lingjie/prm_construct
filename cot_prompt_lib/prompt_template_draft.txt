Question:
If Buzz bought a pizza with 78 slices at a restaurant and then decided to share it with the waiter in the ratio of 5:8, with Buzz's ratio being 5, what's twenty less the number of slices of pizza that the waiter ate? 
Step 1: The total ratio representing the pizza is 5+8 = <<5+8=13>>13. Step 2: The waiter ate 13 x 8 / 13 = <<13*8/13=6>>6 slices of the pizza. Step 3: Buzz ate 78 - 6 = <<78-6=72>>72 slices of the pizza. Step 4: The waiter ate 20 less than the number of slices that Buzz ate which is 72 - 20 = 52. Step 5: The waiter ate 52 slices of the pizza. The answer is: 52
