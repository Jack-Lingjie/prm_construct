new_ys: [" \nStep 1: The shopper is asserting a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort. Strict liability applies in certain situations, such as when a person or entity is engaged in an ultra-hazardous activity or when they are selling a product that is defective.\nStep 2: The carpenter was hired by the grocery store to hang the mirror, which was provided by the manufacturer. The carpenter's primary role was to install the mirror, not to manufacture or sell it.\nStep 3: While the carpenter may have been involved in the installation of the defective brackets, they were not engaged in the sale of the mirror. The shopper is not asserting a claim against the manufacturer or the grocery store, but rather the carpenter.\nStep 4: Ultra-hazardous activities typically involve inherently dangerous activities or conditions, such as maintaining a wild animal or storing hazardous materials. Hanging a mirror, even a large one, does not fall into this category.\nStep 5: The shopper's claim against the carpenter would likely be based on negligence rather than strict liability. To prevail on a negligence claim, the shopper would need to show that the carpenter failed to exercise reasonable care in hanging the mirror.\n\nThe answer is: C", " \nStep 1: The shopper is asserting a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort. Strict liability applies in certain situations, such as when a person or entity is engaged in an ultra-hazardous activity or when they are selling a product that is defective.\nStep 2: The shopper was injured by a falling mirror that was installed by the carpenter. The carpenter's actions led to the shopper's injuries, and the carpenter's responsibility is not directly related to the sale of the mirror. \nStep 3: The shopper's claim is based on the carpenter's installation of the mirror, which is a service rather than a product. Therefore, the carpenter would not be held strictly liable under the same rules that apply to manufacturers of defective products.\nStep 4: The shopper's claim would be more likely to succeed under a negligence theory, but the question specifically asks about strict liability.\nThe answer is: C", " \nStep 1: The shopper is asserting a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort. Strict liability applies in certain situations, such as when a person or entity is engaged in an ultra-hazardous activity or when they are selling a product that is defective.\nStep 2: The shopper was injured by a defect in the brackets, which were provided by the manufacturer and installed by the carpenter.\nStep 3: In this scenario, the carpenter was hired to hang the mirror, but the defect was in the brackets, not in the carpenter's installation. Therefore, the carpenter is not engaged in the sale of the product, which is a key factor in strict liability claims.\nStep 4: The shopper was a bystander who was injured by the defective product, not a consumer of the product or a person who was injured in a situation related to the carpenter's business.\n\nThe answer is: C", ' \n\nStep 1: The shopper is claiming strict liability in tort against the carpenter, which means they are seeking damages without needing to prove negligence on the part of the carpenter.\nStep 2: Strict liability in tort typically applies to situations where a person or entity is engaged in an ultra-hazardous activity or is in a position of control over a product that causes harm to another person.\nStep 3: In this case, the carpenter was hired to install the mirror and brackets, but the mirror itself was provided by the manufacturer. The shopper is suing the carpenter, not the manufacturer.\nStep 4: The key issue here is whether the carpenter was engaged in an ultra-hazardous activity or was in control of a product that caused harm to the shopper.\nStep 5: Installing a mirror with brackets and bolts is not typically considered an ultra-hazardous activity.

The carpenter's primary role was to install the mirror, not to manufacture or sell it.\nStep 3: The shopper's injuries were caused by a defect in the brackets provided by the manufacturer. The carpenter's actions may have contributed to the installation of the defective brackets, but they were not selling the product.\nStep 4: The shopper's claim is more closely related to the manufacturer's product liability than to the carpenter's installation of the product. The carpenter's relationship with the shopper is not a key factor in determining liability in this scenario.\nStep 5: Ultra-hazardous activities are typically associated with situations where the activity itself poses a significant risk of harm to others, regardless of the level of care taken. The installation of a mirror by a carpenter is not an ultra-hazardous activity.\n\nThe answer is: C", " \nStep 1: The shopper is asserting a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort.

The carpenter's primary role was to install the mirror, not to manufacture or sell it.\nStep 3: Ultra-hazardous activities typically involve activities such as storing flammable liquids or performing high-voltage electrical work. Hanging a mirror is not considered an ultra-hazardous activity.\nStep 4: The manufacturer provided the brackets and bolts, which were defective. However, the shopper is asserting a claim against the carpenter, not the manufacturer.\nStep 5: The shopper was injured when the mirror fell from the wall due to the defective brackets. The carpenter's installation of the mirror did not create a risk of harm, but rather was a response to the defective product provided by the manufacturer.\nStep 6: The carpenter does not have a relationship of privity with the shopper, but this is not the most relevant factor in determining the outcome of the claim.\nStep 7: Review the options to identify the one that best aligns with the facts and the law of strict liability in tort.\n\nThe answer is: C", " \nStep 1: The shopper is asserting a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort.

This could be a potential claim, but it's not directly related to the carpenter's responsibility under strict liability.\nStep 5: Option B mentions that maintaining a large mirror on the wall of a retail outlet would be abnormally dangerous. This is not relevant to the situation, as the carpenter's actions led to the shopper's injuries, not the placement of the mirror itself.\nStep 6: Option C mentions that the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.

The shopper was injured by a defect in the brackets, not by the carpenter's installation of the mirror itself.\nStep 5: Strict liability does not typically apply to services, only to the sale of products.

The carpenter's role in installing the mirror is not directly related to the sale of the product, so option C is not the correct answer.\nStep 5: The carpenter did have a relationship with the plaintiff, as the carpenter was hired to install the mirror in the store where the shopper was injured. However, this relationship is not directly relevant to the shopper's claim of strict liability.\nStep 6: The shopper's injury was caused by a defect in the brackets, which is a product-related issue. The carpenter's role in installing the mirror does not necessarily make them liable for defects in the product itself.\nStep 7: Given the facts, the shopper is more likely to prevail if the carpenter was engaged in an ultra-hazardous activity or if the shopper can establish a claim based on the carpenter's installation of the defective brackets.\nStep 8: Since the carpenter's actions do not fit neatly into either ultra-hazardous activity or strict liability for defective products, the shopper's claim of strict liability in tort is unlikely to prevail.\nThe answer is: C", " \nStep 1: The shopper is asserting a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort.

The carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror, and there is no indication that the activity of hanging the mirror was ultra-hazardous or that the carpenter was in a position of control over the defective product.\nStep 4: The key issue here is whether the carpenter had a relationship of privily with the shopper, which would be relevant to a claim of negligence.

Since the carpenter was hired to hang the mirror, not sell it, the sale of a defective product is not applicable.\nStep 5: The shopper's claim against the carpenter is based on the carpenter's installation of the mirror, not the sale of the mirror.
