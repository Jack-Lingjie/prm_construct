Question:
Which of the following represents an accurate statement concerning arthropods?
Options:
A. They possess an exoskeleton composed primarily of peptidoglycan.
B. They possess an open circulatory system with a dorsal heart.
C. They are members of a biologically unsuccessful phylum incapable of exploiting diverse habitats and nutrition sources.
D. They lack paired, jointed appendages.
Answer: Let's think step by step. Peptidoglycan is known to comprise the plasma membrane of most bacteria, rather than the exoskeleton of arthropods, which is made of chitin, which rules out (A). The answer (C) is false because arthropods are a highly successful phylum. Likewise, arthropods have paired, jointed appendages, which rules out (D). The only remaining option is (B), as arthropods have an open circulatory system with a dorsal tubular heart. The answer is (B).

Question:
In a given population, 1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by a completely recessive allele, b. Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which of the following is the expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer?
Options:
A. 19/400
B. 1/400
C. 40/400
D. 38/400
E. 2/400
F. 1/200
G. 20/400
H. 50/400
Answer: Let's think step by step. According to the Hardy Weinberg Law, $p^2 + 2 p q + q^2 = 1$, and $p + q = 1$ where $p$ is the frequency of the dominant allele, $q$ is the frequency of the recessive allele, and $p^2$, $q^2$, and $2pq$ are the frequencies of dominant homozygous, recessive homozygous, and heterozygous individuals, respectively. ​The frequency of the recessive allele (q) is $\sqrt{\frac{1}{400}} = 0.05$. We have $p = 1 - q = 0.95$. The frequency of heterozygous individuals is $2pq = 2 \cdot 0.05 \cdot 0.95 = 0.095$. The number of heterozygous individuals is equal to the frequency of heterozygous individuals times the size of the population, or $0.095 * 400 = 38$. So we end up with 38/400. The answer is (D).

Question:
A mutation in a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme’s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity?
Options:
A. By changing the enzyme’s pH optimum
B. By changing the enzyme's molecular weight
C. An amino acid change away from the active site increases the enzyme's substrate specificity.
D. By changing the shape of the protein
E. By changing the enzyme's temperature optimum
F. By altering the enzyme's ability to be denatured
G. By changing the enzyme’s location in the cell
H. By changing the enzyme's color
I. An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity.
J. By altering the enzyme's rate of reaction
Answer: Let's think step by step. A change in an amino acid leads to a change in the primary structure of the protein. A change in the primary structure may lead to a change in the secondary and the tertiary structure of the protein. A change in the tertiary structure means a change in the shape of the protein, so (C) has to be correct. Since the change does not affect the active site of the enzyme, we do not expect the activity of the enzyme to be affected. The answer is (D).

Question:
Which of the following represents an accurate statement concerning arthropods?
Options:
A. They possess an exoskeleton composed primarily of peptidoglycan.
B. They possess an open circulatory system with a dorsal heart.
C. They are members of a biologically unsuccessful phylum incapable of exploiting diverse habitats and nutrition sources.
D. They lack paired, jointed appendages.

Question:
Predict the number of lines in the EPR spectrum of a solution of 13C-labelled methyl radical (13CH3•), assuming the lines do not overlap.
Options:
A. 10
B. 8
C. 4
D. 20
E. 12
F. 3
G. 16
H. 5
I. 24
J. 6
Answer: Let's think step by step. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum will be split by two forms of interactions. The first is the hyperfine interaction with the 13C (nuclear spin $I = 
\frac{1}{2}$) which will split the spectrum into 2 lines. This will be further split into 4 lines by the interaction with three equivalent 1H nuclei. The total number of lines is therefore $2 \cdot 4 = 8$. The answer is (B).

Question:
Which of the following lists the hydrides of group-14 elements in order of thermal stability, from lowest to highest?
Options:
A. GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < SiH4 < CH4
B. SiH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < CH4
C. PbH4 < CH4 < SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4
D. PbH4 < SnH4 < CH4 < GeH4 < SiH4
E. SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 < PbH4 < CH4
F. CH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < SiH4
G. SiH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < GeH4 < CH4
H. CH4 < SiH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4
I. CH4 < PbH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < SiH4
J. PbH4 < SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 < CH4
Answer: Let's think step by step. The thermal stability of group-14 hydrides decreases as we move from the top of group 14 to the bottom. The order of elements in the group from top to bottom is C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb. Therefore in order of increasing thermal stability we have PbH4, SnH4, GeH4, SiH4, and CH4, or answer (J). The answer is (J).

Question:
Which of the following is considered an acid anhydride?
Options:
A. H2SO3
B. NaCl
C. CH4
D. HNO3
E. SO2
F. Al(NO3)3
G. CaCO3
H. H2O
I. HCl
Answer: Let's think step by step. An acid anhydride is a compound that is derived by removing water from an acid. The chemical formula for water is H2O, which means that we need to determine which of these options, when combined with H2O, forms an acid. SO2, or Sulfur dioxide, when combined with H2O, makes H2SO4, or sulfuric acid. The answer is (E).

Question:
This question refers to the following information.
In Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&…
"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery."
Then, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.
His voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on étienne, directly addressing him:
"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place."
émile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885

Question:
This question refers to the following information.
The following excerpt is from a pamphlet.
You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.
The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.
The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.
I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.
I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.
All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.
I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.
—Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794–1795

Question:
This question refers to the following information.
"The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries. It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.
Non-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments…The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny."

Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. This is a formal logic problem about stationally process. For a stationary autoregressive process, shocks will eventually die away. The answer is (F).

Question:
Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options:
A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question:
The symmetric group $S_n$ has $
\factorial{n}$ elements, hence it is not true that $S_{10}$ has 10 elements.
Find the characteristic of the ring 2Z.
Options:
A. 0
B. 30
C. 3
D. 10
E. 12
F. 50
G. 2
H. 100
I. 20
J. 5
Answer: Let's think step by step. A characteristic of a ring is R is $n$ if the statement $ka = 0$ for all $a\in 2Z$ implies that $k$ is a multiple of $n$. Assume that $ka = 0$ for all $a\in 2Z$ for some $k$. In particular $2k = 0$. Hence $k=0$ and $n=0$. The answer is (A).

Question:
Let V be the set of all real polynomials p(x). Let transformations T, S be defined on V by T:p(x) -> xp(x) and S:p(x) -> p'(x) = d/dx p(x), and interpret (ST)(p(x)) as S(T(p(x))). Which of the following is true?
Options:
A. ST + TS is the identity map of V onto itself.
B. TS = 0
C. ST = 1
D. ST - TS = 0
E. ST = T
F. ST = 0
G. ST = TS
H. ST - TS is the identity map of V onto itself.
I. TS = T
J. ST = S
Answer: Let's think step by step. For a given polynomial $p$ we have
\[ST(p) = (xp(x))’ = p(x) + xp’(x)\]
and
\[TS(p) = xp’(x).\]
Hence \[ST(p) - TS(p) = p(x) + xp’(x) - xp’(x).\] The answer is (H).

Question:
Let A be the set of all ordered pairs of integers (m, n) such that 7m + 12n = 22. What is the greatest negative number in the set B = {m + n : (m, n) \in A}?
Options:
A. -5
B. 0
C. -3
D. -7
E. -4
F. -6
G. -1
H. -2
I. -9
Answer: Let's think step by step. We have 12n = 22 - 7m and one of the solutions is $m = -2$, $n = 3$. Then $m + n = 1$, hence we need to look for smaller $m$ in order to make $m + n$ negative. The next solution is $m = -14$ and $n = 10$. For smaller $m$ we have $m + n$ smaller than $-4$. The answer is (E).

physics
The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about physics. Think step by step and then finish your answer with "the answer is (X)" where X is the correct letter choice.
Question:
Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?
Options:
A. 1000 times more
B. 50 times more
C. 5000 times more
D. 500 times more
E. 10000 times more
F. 20000 times more
G. 2000 times more
H. 100 times more
I. 10 times more
Answer: Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture area $A = \pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer is (E).

Question:
Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?
Options:
A. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.
B. The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the asteroid belt.
C. The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.
D. The Oort cloud; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.
E. The Oort Cloud; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Oort Cloud.
F. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.
G. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.
Answer: Let's think step by step. Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt, and we know because short period coments tend to be in the plane of the solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. The answer is (A).

Question:
A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is
Options:
A. 10
B. 40
C. 6
D. 25
E. 15
F. 50
G. 30
H. 4
I. 5
J. 20
Answer: Let's think step by step. In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (H).

computer science

Question:
A certain pipelined RISC machine has 8 general-purpose registers R0, R1, . . . , R7 and supports the following operations:
ADD Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Add Rs1 to Rs2 and put the sum in Rd)
MUL Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Multiply Rs1 by Rs2 and put the product in Rd)
An operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence.
Consider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in registers R0, R1, R2. If the contents of these three registers must not be modified, what is the minimum number of clock cycles required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC?
Options:
A. 10
B. 6
C. 9
D. 5
E. 12
F. 4
G. 7
H. 8
Answer: Let's think step by step. First, we are given that A is in R0, B is in R1, and C is in R2.
Next, we can see that we must compute three multiplies (AB, BC, and ABC) and two adds (AB + ABC, (AB + ABC) + BC) to compute our final answer, resulting in a minimum of five clock cycles.
Next, we can see that there is no way to avoid at least one pipeline stall when computing our final answer, because to compute our final sum we must wait at least one cycle for the results from the previous stage to be ready. Thus, our minimum number of cycles must be 6.
We can verify that we can create a solution that requires only six cycles as follows:
compute AB: MUL R0, R1, R3
compute BC: MUL R1, R2, R4
compute ABC: MUL R3, R4, R5
compute AB + BC: ADD R3, R4, R6
STALL
compute AB + ABC + BC: ADD R5, R6, R7
So there are 6 cycles. The answer is (B).

Question:
A compiler generates code for the following assignment statement.
G := (A + B) * C - (D + E) * F
The target machine has a single accumulator and a single-address instruction set consisting of instructions load, store, add, subtract, and multiply. For the arithmetic operations, the left operand is taken from the accumulator and the result appears in the accumulator. The smallest possible number of instructions in the resulting code is
Options:
A. 7
B. 5
C. 12
D. 4
E. 11
F. 6
G. 8
H. 10
I. 9
J. 3
Answer: Let's think step by step. We can compute the final answer with the following sequence of operations:
1. LOAD D  (accumulator = D)
2. ADD E  (accumulator = D+E)
3. MUL F  (accumulator = (D+E)*F)
4. STORE X (X = (D+E)*F)
5. LOAD A  (accumulator = A)
6. ADD B  (accumulator = A+B)
7. MUL C  (accumulator = (A+B)*C)
8. SUB X  (accumulator = (A+B)*C - (D+E)*F)
9. STORE G (G = (A+B)*C - (D+E)*F)
This sequence takes 9 instructions. The answer is (I).

E. 2048 bits
F. 820 bits
G. 128 bits
H. 512 bits
I. 1024 bits
J. 64 bits
Answer: Let's think step by step. Since SHA-1 is a hash function which takes an input and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value, its message digest is 160 bits. The answer is (C).

Question:
Which of the given formulas of PL is the best symbolization of the following sentence?
Turtles live long lives and are happy creatures, unless they are injured.
Options:
A. (L • H) ≡ I
B. (L • H) ∨ I
C. L • (H ∨ I)
D. L • (H ⊃ R).
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help. Let’s solve this step by step. Let “L” denote “living long”, H “being happy”, and “I” “being injured”. Now, consider each choice:
(A) means (living long AND being happy) is equivalent to (being injured). 
(B) means (living long AND being happy) OR (being injured). 
(C) means (living long) AND (being happy OR being injured). 
(D) means (living long) AND (being happy implies being R), but what R denotes is not clear.
Obviously, (B) is the best symbolization of the original sentence. The answer is (B).

Question:
Select the best translation into predicate logic.George borrows Hector's lawnmower. (g: George; h: Hector; l: Hector's lawnmower; Bxyx: x borrows y from z).
Options:
A. Bhgh
B. Bggh
C. Bhlh
D. Bghl
E. Bhlg
F. Blhg
G. Bllg
H. Blgh
I. Bhhg
J. Bglh
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help. Let’s solve this step by step. We are told that “Bxyx” means “x borrows y from z”. We can rewrite “George borrows Hector's lawnmower” as “George borrows a lawnmower from Hector”, which can then be translated into predicate logic as “Bglh”. The answer “Bglh” appears in (J); therefore, (J) must be the correct answer. The answer is (J).

Question:
A point pole has a strength of 4π * 10^-4 weber. The force in newtons on a point pole of 4π * 1.5 * 10^-4 weber placed at a distance of 10 cm from it will be
Options:
A. 25 N.
B. 12.5 N.
C. 15 N.
D. 10 N.
E. 7.5 N.
F. 20 N.
G. 5 N.
H. 3.75 N.
Answer: Let's think step by step. The force between two point poles is given by m_1m_2/(mu_0 4 \pi r^2), in analogy to Coulomb’s law. Plugging in the values given in the question, we calculate that the force is approximately 15 N. The answer is (C).

Question:
The coil of a moving coil meter has 100 turns, is 40 mm long and 30 mm wide. The control torque is 240*10-6 N-m on full scale. If magnetic flux density is 1Wb/m2 range of meter is
Options:
A. 2 mA.
B. 5 mA.
C. 1.5 mA.
D. 0.5 mA.
E. 6 mA.
F. 4 mA.
G. 3 mA.
H. 1 mA.
I. 2.5 mA.
J. 3.5 mA.
Answer: Let's think step by step. The torque on a coil in a uniform magnetic field is given by BANI, where B is the magnetic flux density, A is the area of the coil, N is the number of turns, and I is the current. So we have that I = (Torque)/(BAN), or 240e-6/(1200e-6 * 100 * 1) = 2e-3. The answer is (A).

Question:
In an SR latch built from NOR gates, which condition is not allowed
Options:
A. S=0, R=2
B. S=2, R=2
C. S=1, R=1
D. S=1, R=-1
E. S=1, R=2
F. S=0, R=0
G. S=2, R=0
H. S=1, R=0
I. S=2, R=1
J. S=0, R=1
Answer: Let's think step by step. An SR latch is a set-reset latch; in the case where S=1 and R=1, the circuit has no stable state; instead a race condition will be produced within the circuit, so the device will be in an undefined state. So S=1, R=1 is an illegal input. The answer is (C).
