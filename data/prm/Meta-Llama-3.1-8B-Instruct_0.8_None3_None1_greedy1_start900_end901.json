Since the carpenter was hired to hang the mirror, not sell it, the sale of a defective product is not applicable.\nStep 5: The shopper's claim against the carpenter is based on the carpenter's installation of the mirror, not the sale of the mirror. Therefore, the shopper's claim is not based on the sale of a defective product, which eliminates option A.\nStep 6: Option B is also incorrect because hanging a large mirror is not typically considered an abnormally dangerous activity.\nStep 7: Option D is incorrect because the carpenter's relationship to the plaintiff is not relevant to the shopper's claim of strict liability.\nStep 8: Given that the shopper's claim is based on the carpenter's installation of the mirror, the shopper will not prevail because the carpenter is not engaged in the sale of the mirror, which is the typical scenario for strict liability.\n\nThe answer is: C", "hard_estimation": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "soft_estimation": [0.7777777777777778, 1.0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "gt_answer": "C", "pred": "C"}
