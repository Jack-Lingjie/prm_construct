We refer to Wikipedia articles on international law for help. As \"ad hoc\" implies, a judge ad hoc is appointed only for a specific case or period, when a party to a contentious case before the International Court of Justice does not have a regular national sitting as judge. The answer is (I).\\n\\nQuestion:\\nFunctions of the law include all but which of the following?\\nOptions:\\nA. defining the limits of government power\\nB. regulating the use of public spaces\\nC. keeping the peace\\nD. maximizing individual freedom\\nE. maintaining order and stability\\nF. preventing environmental degradation\\nG. providing a basis for compromise\\nH. promoting social justice\\nI. promoting the principles of the free enterprise system\\nJ. encouraging economic growth\\nAnswer: Let\\'s think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on jurisprudence for help. Laws are fundamentally about helping resolve disputes between individuals, and therefore essential for maximizing individual freedom, providing a basis for compromise, and keeping the peace.

We refer to Wikipedia articles on jurisprudence for help. Natural Law School of jurisprudence focuses on the laws of nature, and states that the law should be based on ethics, morals, and what is \"correct\". Analytical deals with the law as it already exists, Historical postulates that the law was found and not made, and Sociological studies how the law and society impact each other. The answer is (J).\\n\\nQuestion:\\nA grocery store purchased a large mirror to hang on a wall in the store. Along with the mirror itself, the manufacturer provided brackets and bolts to be used for hanging the mirror. The grocery store paid a local carpenter to come in and hang the mirror.

To the south of the man\\'s land was a lot owned by a woman who lived on it in a house. Five years ago the man conveyed a right-of-way easement over his land to the woman because it provided a more direct route between her house and the highway. The easement was evidenced by a clearly marked path. The document granting the easement was promptly recorded. Three years ago, the woman conveyed her house to the man. The man never took actual possession of the house. Two years ago, the man conveyed the house to a purchaser by a warranty deed. Two months after the purchaser moved into the house, a neighbor informed him about the easement. He then began using the path that had been marked on the man\\'s land. When the man noticed the purchaser using the path, he erected a barricade on his land that effectively prevented the purchaser from using the path. The purchaser has sued the man, claiming that he has an easement over the man\\'s land. Who is likely to prevail?\\nOptions:\\nA. The man, because the easement was extinguished.\\nB. The man, because the purchaser did not have actual notice of the easement at the time of acquisition.\\nC. The purchaser, because he purchased the house by warranty deed.\\nD. The purchaser, because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house.\\nAnswer: Let\\'s think step by step.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n'\n",
